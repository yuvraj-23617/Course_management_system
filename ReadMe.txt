I have incorporated generic programming, object classes, and exception handling into my solution in several ways:

1. Generic Programming:

The code uses generic programming primarily through the GenericPair class and the GenericClass within the Admin class. The GenericPair class allows for flexible storage of two values of different types, which is used for storing course ratings. It has two type parameters T and U, allowing it to hold pairs of values of any types. This class is used in the ArrayList<GenericPair<String, Integer>> ratingsforcourse, demonstrating how generics can be used to create type-safe collections.

The GenericClass within the Admin class is another example, showing a simple generic class that can hold and display any type of value. This demonstrates how generics can be used to create reusable code that works with multiple types.

2. Object Classes:

the solution extensively uses object-oriented programming with several classes representing different entities in the system:

- User (base class)
- Student (extends User)
- Admin (extends User)
- TeachingAssistant (extends Student)
- Course
- Complaint

Each of these classes encapsulates related data and behavior. For example, the User class contains basic information and methods common to all users, while specific types of users (Student, Admin, TeachingAssistant) extend this class and add their own specialized methods and attributes. This demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism, key concepts in object-oriented programming.

The Course and Complaint classes represent other entities in the system, each with their own attributes and methods. This encapsulation of data and behavior into classes helps organize the code and makes it easier to manage and extend the system.

3. Exception Handling:

I've implemented custom exceptions and used try-catch blocks to handle potential errors. The custom exceptions include:

- CourseFullException
- DropDeadlinePassedException

These exceptions are used to handle specific error conditions in the course enrollment and drop processes. For example, CourseFullException is thrown when a student tries to enroll in a course but the maximum capacity has been reached.

The code also includes try-catch blocks to handle these exceptions. For instance, in the main method, there are try-catch blocks around the calls to addCourse and dropCourse methods. If an exception is thrown, it's caught and an appropriate error message is displayed to the user.

This use of custom exceptions and try-catch blocks allows for more granular error handling and helps improve the robustness of the application by gracefully handling potential error conditions.

In summary, my solution effectively incorporates generic programming for flexible and type-safe code, object-oriented programming for organizing and structuring the system, and exception handling for robust error management. These features contribute to a more flexible, maintainable, and reliable codebase for your college management system.
